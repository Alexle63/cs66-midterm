New Title: Analysis of Classical, Ensemble, and Deep Learning Models on the EEGEyeNet Dataset
	   (Which model is the best at analyzing the EEGEyeNet Dataset?)

Alt. Title: Analysis of Results and Runtimes of Classical, Ensemble, and Deep Learning Models on the EEGEyeNet Dataset
	     (Is the 0.1% increase in accuracy/precision really worth an extra 10 minutes of runtime?)
	     (Accuracy: Are the guesses close to the actual answer?)
	     (Precision: Are the guesses confident and close to one another? (small deviation, guesses very close and clustered))
	     (Compare the different SVM and KNN Variations found at http://yann.lecun.org/exdb/mnist/)

Introduction
   - Background
   - Motivation
      - GRAPH (Graph of SOMETHING)
   - Research Question
      - GRAPH (Image of CNN and a paragraph on how it works?)
   - Dataset and Methods (THESE ARE PROPOSED, DON'T ACTUALLY IMPLEMENT ANY CODE)
Related Work
   - Prior Work (1 paper, *should* be the EEGEyeNet Paper)
   - State-of-the-art (1 paper, maybe a paper on CNN's)
   - STATE OF THE ART GRAPH (maybe a graph from the paper above)

Steps:
1) Cut out everything except introduction and literature review/related work/state-of-the-art articles
   - Mention VERY CLEARLY that the dataset being used is the EEGEyeNet Dataset, WHICH IS FOUND AT CITATION/LINK <INSERT CITATION>.

2) Add more methods that was not included in the paper
   - Polynomial Regression (Linear is 1, polynomial is 2+, try powers 2-10) (STRONG CONTENDER, WAS NOT USED IN ANALYSIS OF EEGEyeNet PAPER)
   - SVM and KNN Variations found at http://yann.lecun.org/exdb/mnist/
REMINDER: YOU DON'T HAVE TO CODE THESE, JUST MENTION THAT YOU PLAN TO USE THESE IN THE PAPER,
          WHAT THEY DO AS AN ALGORITHM, AND WHY YOU WANT TO USE THEM
REMINDER: MENTION THAT THE RUNTIME OF EACH ALGORITHM WILL BE MEASURED AND BE CONSIDERED IN THE ANALYSIS (Maybe Accuracy/runtime?)
